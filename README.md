# Pascal Parser and Interpreter
This project includes a parser and interpreter for the pascal programming language. Most of the files in this project are generated by antlr4. The files that contain code I wrote are in the files: EvalVisitor.java, Frame.java, Pair.java, Project2.g4.

### Run Tests
-antlr4 Project2.g4 -visitor
-javac *.java
-java EvalVisitor tests/test1.pas

There are 13 tests each ending with 1-13
ex: test1.pas-test13.pas.

The program is case insensitive.

With nested functions you can't set the return value of one function directly to the value a function returns. You have to store the return value of the function that is called and then set the return value of the current function equal to the variable.

I implemented break to break until it reaches a function/procedure or the main block. Continue just exits the current if/case statement or for/while loop.

You have to use the keyword procedure or function everytime you declare a procedure or function. You can't declare functions and procedures inside of eachother and they can only be declared before the first main block.

Each test has the purpose and expected output in a comment towards the top of the file. A couple also require user input and will specify what to input in the comment as well.
